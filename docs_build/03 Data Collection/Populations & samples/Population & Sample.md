### Definitions
- A **population** is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.

- A **sample** is the specific group that you will collect data from. The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population.

- In research, a population doesn’t always refer to people. It can mean a group containing elements of anything you want to study, such as objects, events, organizations, countries, species, organisms, etc.

### Reasons for sampling

-   **Necessity**: Sometimes it’s simply not possible to study the whole population due to its size or inaccessibility.
-   **Practicality**: It’s easier and more efficient to collect data from a sample.
-   **Cost-effectiveness**: There are fewer participant, laboratory, equipment, and researcher costs involved.
-   **Manageability**: Storing and running statistical analyses on smaller datasets is easier and reliable.

### Population parameter vs. sample statistic
- A [**parameter**](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/parameter-vs-statistic/) is a measure that describes the whole population. 
- A **statistic** is a measure that describes the sample.
- You can use estimation or [hypothesis testing](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/hypothesis-testing/) to estimate how likely it is that a sample statistic differs from the population parameter.

### Sampling error
- A sampling error is the difference between a population parameter and a sample statistic. In your study, the sampling error is the difference between the *mean political attitude rating of your sample* and *the true mean political attitude rating of all undergraduate students in the Netherlands.*

- Sampling errors happen even when you use a randomly selected sample. This is because random samples are not identical to the population in terms of numerical measures like [means](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/mean/) and [standard deviations](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/standard-deviation/).

- Because the aim of scientific research is to [generalize](https://www.scribbr.com/research-bias/generalizability/) findings from the sample to the population, you want the sampling error to be low. You can reduce sampling error by increasing the sample size.
