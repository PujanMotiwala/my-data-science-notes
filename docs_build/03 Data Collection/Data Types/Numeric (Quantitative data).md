- Amount of some kind (mostly expressed as numbers)
- There are two primary types: 
	- #Discrete Data
	- #Continuous data.

## What is #Discrete Data (Integers) ?

> A finite number of data values

Example: 
-   The number of employees in your department
-   The number of new customers you signed on last quarter
-   The number of products currently held in inventory

## What is #Continuous Data (Ratio) ?

> Measurements that can be broken down into smaller individual parts.

OR

> An infinite number of possible values that can be measured.

Example:
-   The height or weight of a person
-   The daily temperature in your city
-   The amount of time needed to complete a task or project

## Questions to determine

-   Can these values be counted?
-   Can these values be measured?
-   Can these values be broken down into smaller parts and still make sense?

## What is #Interval Data ?
**Definition**:
• Numerical data where the intervals between values are interpretable, but there is no true zero point. This means that while differences between data points are meaningful, ratios are not.

**Characteristics**:
- **Equidistant Scale**: Equal intervals between values on the scale, which allows for meaningful addition and subtraction.
- **No True Zero**: Zero does not imply ‘none’; rather, it is another point on the scale. For example, zero degrees Celsius does not mean ‘no temperature’.

**Examples**:
- Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
- Calendar years
- IQ scores

**Questions to Determine Interval Data**:
- Can these values be added or subtracted meaningfully?
- Is there a meaningful zero that indicates a total absence of the quantity?

**Common Analyses for Interval Data**:

  1. **Mean and Median**: Useful for finding the central tendency.
  2. **Standard Deviation and Variance**: Measure spread around the mean.
  3. **Regression Analysis**: Useful for predicting trends and relationships.
  4. **Correlation Coefficients**: Quantify the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

## What is #Ratio Data ?

**Definition**:
The highest level of measurement that allows for the identification of differences, the ordering of data, and the meaningful calculation of ratios. This is due to the presence of an absolute zero.

**Characteristics**:
- **True Zero Point**: Zero indicates the absence of the quantity being measured, making operations like multiplication and division meaningful.
- **All Mathematical Operations**: Ratio data supports counting, ordering, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.

**Examples**:
- Weight
- Height
- Money
- Age

**Questions to Determine Ratio Data**:

- Can these values be counted?
- Can these values be measured?
- Can ratios of these measurements be calculated? (e.g., one value can be twice another)

**Common Analyses for Ratio Data**:
1. **Geometric Mean and Harmonic Mean**: In addition to arithmetic mean, these are meaningful for ratio data.
2. **Coefficient of Variation**: Measures relative variability and is meaningful due to the true zero point.
3. **Logarithmic Transformation**: Often used prior to analysis to handle skewed data.
4. **Multiplicative Models**: Useful because multiplication and division are meaningful with ratio scales.

**Example Questions for Analysis**

**Interval Data**
- **Temperature Analysis**: What is the average temperature increase per month?
- **IQ Analysis**: How does the IQ level distribution compare across different age groups?

**Ratio Data**

- **Economic Analysis**: What is the relative growth rate of different economies?
- **Health Analysis**: How does the weight of an individual affect their health outcomes?

**Summary**

#Interval Data:
- Suitable for operations like addition and subtraction but not for meaningful ratios.
- Analytical focus on differences and averages without considering ratios.

#Ratio Data:
- Supports a wide range of mathematical operations, including meaningful ratios.
- Analysis can extend to growth rates, proportions, and relative changes.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for selecting the appropriate statistical techniques and ensuring that your analyses are accurate and meaningful.
