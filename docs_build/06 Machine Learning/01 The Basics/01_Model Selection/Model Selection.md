[[Model Selection]]Â is the process of choosing between the different learning algorithms for modelling the data.
For example, 
- for solving a classification problem the choices could be made between Logistic Regression, SVM, Tree-based algorithms etc. 
- for a regression problem decisions also need to be made for the degree of linear regression algorithms.
