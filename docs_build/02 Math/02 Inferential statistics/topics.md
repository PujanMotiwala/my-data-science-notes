There are many advanced topics in statistics that are useful for different applications and fields. Some of the most popular topics include:

1.  Bayesian statistics: This approach uses probability distributions to represent uncertainty and uses Bayes' theorem to update these distributions as new data becomes available. This is particularly useful for problems with complex models or for problems where prior information is available.
    
2.  Time series analysis: This is a method for analyzing data that is collected over time. It is often used to model and forecast trends in financial, economic, and ecological systems.
    
3.  Multivariate statistics: This deals with the analysis of data with multiple variables. It includes techniques such as principal component analysis, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis, which are useful for dimensionality reduction and feature selection.
    
4.  Nonparametric statistics: These methods do not make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. They include techniques such as kernel density estimation, bootstrapping, and permutation tests, which are useful for problems with complex or unknown distributions.
    
5.  Machine learning: This is a field that involves the use of statistical techniques to build models that can learn from data and make predictions. It includes techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines, which are useful for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.
    
6.  Survival Analysis: This is the study of time to an event of interest, such as death or failure. It includes techniques such as Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazard model and Aalen's additive hazard model.
    
7.  Econometrics: This field deals with the use of statistical methods to study economic data, such as time series data on gross domestic product, inflation, and unemployment.
    

These are just a few examples, but there are many other advanced topics in statistics that are worth exploring depending on your interests and the specific problems you are trying to solve.
