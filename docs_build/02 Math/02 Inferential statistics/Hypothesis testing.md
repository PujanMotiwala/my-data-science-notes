- As per the definition from Oxford languages, a **hypothesis** is a **supposition or proposed explanation** made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.
- As per the dictionary, **Hypothesis** means: *a proposition or set of propositions, set forth as an explanation for the occurrence of some specified group of phenomena, either asserted merely as a provisional conjecture to guide investigation (working hypothesis) or accepted as highly probable in the light of established facts.*
- The hypothesis can be defined as the claim that can either be related to the truth about something that exists in the world, or, truth about something that’s needs to be established a fresh.
- Until the claim is proven to be true, it is called the hypothesis. Once the claim is proved, it becomes the new truth about the thing.
- For **example**, let’s say that a claim is made that students studying for more than 6 hours a day gets more than 90% of marks in their examination. Now, this is just a claim or a hypothesis and not the truth in the real world. However, in order for the claim to become the truth for widespread adoption, it needs to be proved using pieces of evidence, e.g., data.  In order to reject this claim or otherwise, one needs to do some empirical analysis by gathering data samples and evaluating the claim.
- **The process of gathering data and evaluating the claims or hypotheses with the goal to reject or otherwise (failing to reject) is termed** **hypothesis testing**.
- Failing to reject: It means that we don’t have enough evidence to reject the claim. Thus, until the time that new evidence comes up, the claim can be considered the truth.

**The first step to hypothesis testing is defining or stating a hypothesis.** Before the hypothesis can be tested, we need to formulate the hypothesis in terms of mathematical expressions. There are two important aspects to pay attention to, prior to the formulation of the hypothesis. The following represents different types of hypothesis that could be put to hypothesis testing:
