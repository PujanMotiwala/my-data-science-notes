### One way ANOVA

#### 01 Independence of observations
- The data were collected using statistically valid [sampling methods](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/sampling-methods/), and there are no hidden relationships among observations. 
- If your data fail to meet this assumption because you have a [confounding variable](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/confounding-variables/) that you need to control for statistically, use an ANOVA with blocking variables.

#### 02 Normally-distributed response variable
- The values of the dependent variable follow a [normal distribution](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/normal-distribution/).


#### 03 Homogeneity of variance
- The variation within each group being compared is similar for every group. 
- If the variances are different among the groups, then ANOVA probably isn’t the right fit for the data.
