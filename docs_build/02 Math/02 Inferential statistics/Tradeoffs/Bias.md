### Bias
- The ability of our model to predict the values/labels correctly
- Assumptions made by a model to make a function easier to learn.
- It is the error rate of the training data

- #high_bias
	- model is simple, not able to learn from data
	- Error rate has a high value
	- [[Underfitting]] model will have #high_bias 
- #low_bias 
	- model is complex enough, ability to learn the pattern and predictions are close to the target.
	- Error rate has a low value
