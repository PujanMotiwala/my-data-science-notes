# Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics provides methods for drawing conclusions and making predictions about a larger population based on data collected from a smaller sample. It allows us to quantify uncertainty and test hypotheses about the real world.

Key areas covered include:

*   **[[001 Inferential Statistics|Introduction]]**: Core ideas of populations, samples, parameters, and statistics.
*   **[[Estimation/Standard error|Estimation]]**: Using sample data to estimate population parameters, including point estimates and confidence intervals, and understanding the concept of [[Estimation/Standard error|Standard Error]].
*   **[[Hypothesis testing|Hypothesis Testing]]**: The formal framework for making decisions based on data, involving null and alternative hypotheses, test statistics, p-values, and significance levels. ([See Map](./maps/hyp_testing_map.excalidraw.svg)).
*   **[[01 The Basics/Measures of central tendency/Central Tendency|Descriptive Foundations]]**: Review of basic measures like [[01 The Basics/Measures of central tendency/Central Tendency|central tendency]], [[01 The Basics/Measures of variability/Measures of variability|variability]], and key distributions like the [[01 The Basics/Distributions/Guassian Distribution|Gaussian Distribution]].
*   **[[parametric tests/Parametric Tests|Parametric Tests]]**: Statistical tests that assume the data follows specific distributions (often Normal), such as [[parametric tests/01 t test/t test|t-tests]] and [[parametric tests/02 ANOVA/ANOVA|ANOVA]]. Includes discussions on test [[parametric tests/02 ANOVA/Assumptions|Assumptions]] and [[parametric tests/02 ANOVA/Mechanism|Mechanisms]].
*   **(Placeholder: Non-Parametric Tests)**: Tests used when parametric assumptions are not met.
*   **[[Tradeoffs/Tradeoffs|Model Considerations]]**: Understanding fundamental tradeoffs like [[Tradeoffs/Bias|Bias]] vs. [[Tradeoffs/Variance|Variance]].
*   **[[002 Degrees of Freedom|Degrees of Freedom]]**: A concept related to the number of independent pieces of information in a calculation.
*   **[[003 Central Limit Theorem|Central Limit Theorem]]**: A foundational theorem enabling many inferential procedures.
