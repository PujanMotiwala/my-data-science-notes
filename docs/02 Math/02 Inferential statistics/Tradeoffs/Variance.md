### Variance
- It is the difference between the error rate of training data and testing data
- The degree of changes in the model itself with respect to changes in the training data. 
- That means the model needs to change its internal representation to incorporates the pattern in new training data. 

- #high_variance 
	- model is too complex, which makes it unstable and sensitive to patterns (small changes) in new data
	- High difference between training & testing data
	- [[Overfitting]] model will have #high_variance 
- #low_variance 
	- model is robust and simple enough and does not need many changes to incorporate new patterns in data
	- low difference between training & testing data
