- **Measures of central tendency** help you find the middle, or the average, of a dataset. The 3 most common measures of central tendency are the mode, median, and mean.

-  [Mode](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/mode/): the most frequent value.
-  [Median](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/median/): the middle number in an ordered dataset.
-   [Mean](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/mean/): the sum of all values divided by the total number of values.

In addition to central tendency, the variability and distribution of your dataset is important to understand when performing [descriptive statistics](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/descriptive-statistics/).
