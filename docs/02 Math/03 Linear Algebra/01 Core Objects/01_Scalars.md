# Scalars

## Definition / Introduction
*   In the context of Linear Algebra, a **scalar** is simply an **ordinary number**. It's the most basic type of object we deal with.
*   Scalars are used to represent quantities that have magnitude but no direction (unlike vectors).
*   They serve as the building blocks for constructing more complex objects like vectors and matrices, often used to scale (resize) these objects.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Representation
*   Scalars are typically represented by lowercase italic letters (e.g., `c`, `k`, `α`, `λ`).
*   They belong to a field, most commonly the field of **real numbers (ℝ)** in data science applications, but sometimes the field of complex numbers (ℂ).

### 2. Role in Linear Algebra
*   **Scaling:** Scalars are primarily used to multiply vectors or matrices, changing their magnitude (length or size) or reversing their direction (if the scalar is negative). This operation is called scalar multiplication.
*   **Components:** The individual entries within vectors and matrices are themselves scalars.

### 3. Examples in Data Science / AI
*   **Learning Rate (α):** A scalar hyperparameter in optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent, controlling the step size.
*   **Regularization Strength (λ):** A scalar hyperparameter (e.g., in Ridge or Lasso regression) controlling the penalty applied to model complexity.
*   **Feature Values:** A single measurement for a specific feature of a data point (e.g., the height `175.2` cm).
*   **Weights/Biases:** Individual weights or the bias term in a single neuron of a neural network are scalars.
*   **Constants:** Any numerical constant used in formulas or algorithms.

## Connections to Other Topics
*   Scalars are the entries in [[02_Vectors|Vectors]] and [[03_Matrices|Matrices]].
*   Used in **[[01_Vector_Operations|Scalar Multiplication]]** of vectors and matrices.
*   Form the coefficients in **linear combinations** of vectors.

## Summary
*   A **scalar** is just a single number (usually real).
*   Represents magnitude only.
*   Used to scale vectors/matrices and as components within them.
*   Fundamental building block in Linear Algebra.
