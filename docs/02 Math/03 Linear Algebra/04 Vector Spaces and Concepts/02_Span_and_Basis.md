# Span and Basis

## Simple Idea
*   **Span:** Imagine you have a set of [[02_Vectors|vectors]]. The "span" of these vectors is **all the points (or vectors) you can possibly reach** by just stretching, shrinking, and adding your starting vectors together ([[01_Vector_Operations|linear combinations]]). It's the geometric space (like a line, a plane, or the entire 3D space) generated by those vectors.
*   **Basis:** A "basis" for a vector space is like a **minimal set of building block vectors** for that space. It's a small, efficient set of vectors that are independent (no redundancy - [[01_Linear_Independence|linearly independent]]) and whose span covers the *entire* space. Think of them as the fundamental coordinate directions for that space.

## Formal Definitions

### 1. Span
*   The **span** of a set of vectors $S = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, ..., \mathbf{v}_k\}$ is the set of all possible [[01_Vector_Operations|linear combinations]] of these vectors.
    $$ \text{Span}(S) = \left\{ c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k \mid c_1, ..., c_k \in \mathbb{R} \right\} = \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^k c_i \mathbf{v}_i \mid c_i \in \mathbb{R} \right\} $$
*   The span forms a [[../04 Vector Spaces and Concepts/Vector Space|Vector Space]] (or a subspace of a larger vector space).

### 2. Basis
*   A set of vectors $B = \{\mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, ..., \mathbf{b}_n\}$ is a **basis** for a [[../04 Vector Spaces and Concepts/Vector Space|vector space]] $V$ if it satisfies two conditions:
    1.  **[[01_Linear_Independence|Linear Independence]]:** The vectors in $B$ are linearly independent.
    2.  **Spanning:** The vectors span the entire space $V$ ($\text{Span}(B) = V$).
*   **Dimension:** The number of vectors ($n$) in *any* basis for a vector space $V$ is always the same. This number $n$ is called the **dimension** of the vector space $V$, denoted $\dim(V)$.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Geometric Interpretation of Span
*   Span of one non-zero vector: A line through the origin in the direction of the vector.
*   Span of two [[01_Linear_Independence|linearly independent]] vectors: A plane through the origin containing both vectors.
*   Span of three [[01_Linear_Independence|linearly independent]] vectors in 3D space: The entire 3D space ($\mathbb{R}^3$).
*   If vectors are [[01_Linear_Independence|linearly dependent]], adding a dependent vector *does not* increase the dimension of the span (e.g., the span of two vectors lying on the same line is still just that line).

### 2. Properties of a Basis
*   **Minimality:** A basis is a minimal set of vectors that spans the space (removing any vector would make it no longer span the space).
*   **Maximality:** A basis is a maximal set of linearly independent vectors within the space (adding any other vector from the space would make the set linearly dependent).
*   **Unique Representation:** Every vector $\mathbf{v}$ in the space $V$ can be written as a **unique** linear combination of the basis vectors $\{\mathbf{b}_1, ..., \mathbf{b}_n\}$. The coefficients of this combination, $c_1, ..., c_n$, are the **coordinates** of $\mathbf{v}$ relative to that basis $B$. $\mathbf{v} = \sum c_i \mathbf{b}_i$.

### 3. Standard Basis
*   The most common basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the **standard basis** (or natural basis), consisting of vectors $\mathbf{e}_i$ with a single 1 in the $i$-th position and 0s elsewhere.
*   For $\mathbb{R}^2$: $\mathbf{e}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\mathbf{e}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. (Vectors along the x and y axes).
*   For $\mathbb{R}^3$: $\mathbf{e}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\mathbf{e}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\mathbf{e}_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. (Vectors along x, y, z axes).

### 4. Column Space and Row Space
*   **Column Space (Col(A)):** The span of the columns of a [[03_Matrices|matrix]] $\mathbf{A}$. It's the set of all possible outputs $\mathbf{Ax}$. The dimension of the column space is the [[03_Rank|rank]] of the matrix. A basis for Col(A) can be found from the pivot columns of the original matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
*   **Row Space (Row(A)):** The span of the rows of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Its dimension also equals the [[03_Rank|rank]]. A basis for Row(A) can be found from the non-zero rows of the row-echelon form of $\mathbf{A}$.

## Connections to Other Topics
*   **[[01_Linear_Independence|Linear Independence]]** is a requirement for a set to be a basis.
*   The concept of **Dimension** is defined by the size of a basis.
*   The [[03_Rank|Rank]] of a matrix is the dimension of its column space (and row space).
*   **Change of Basis:** Expressing vectors relative to different bases is important in many applications (e.g., [[01_Eigenvalues_and_Eigenvectors|Eigenvectors]] often form a useful basis).
*   **Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA):** Aims to find a lower-dimensional basis (subspace) that captures most of the variance in the data.

## Summary
*   **Span:** The set of all reachable vectors via linear combinations of a starting set. Forms a vector space (line, plane, etc.). $\text{Span}(S) = \{ \sum c_i \mathbf{v}_i \}$.
*   **Basis:** A set of vectors $B$ that is both **[[01_Linear_Independence|linearly independent]]** and **spans** the entire vector space ($\text{Span}(B)=V$).
*   A basis provides a minimal set of "building blocks" or "coordinate directions" for the space.
*   The **number of vectors in a basis** defines the **dimension** of the space.
*   The standard basis ($\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, ...$) is the simplest basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$.
