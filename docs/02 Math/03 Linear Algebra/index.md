# Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning [[01 Core Objects/02_Vectors|vector spaces]] and linear mappings between them. It provides the essential tools for representing and manipulating data, understanding geometric transformations, and solving systems of equations â€“ core operations in machine learning and data analysis.

This section includes:
