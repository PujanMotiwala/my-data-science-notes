# Machine Learning Overview

This section delves into algorithms and techniques that enable systems to learn from data, covering foundational concepts, model types, evaluation, and deployment considerations.

## Key Topics Covered:

*   **[The Basics](./01%20The%20Basics/)**: Core concepts like Model Selection, Evaluation (Over/Underfitting, Metrics), Regularization, Parameter Tuning, and Resampling.
    *   [Ensemble Methods](./01%20The%20Basics/01_Model%20Selection/Ensemble/Ensemble.md): Bagging, Boosting, Stacking.
    *   [Performance Metrics](./01%20The%20Basics/02_Model%20Evaluation/Test%20metrics/Performance%20Metrics/Performance%20Metrics.md): Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, etc.
    *   [Regularization](./01%20The%20Basics/02_Model%20Evaluation/Test%20metrics/Regularization/Regularization.md): Lasso and Ridge regression.
