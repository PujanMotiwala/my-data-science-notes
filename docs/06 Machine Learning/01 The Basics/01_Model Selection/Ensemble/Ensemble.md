[[Ensemble]]

## Definition
- A group of *weak learners* can come together to form a *strong learner*
- better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the base leaners alone
- If one base learner is erroneous, it can be autocorrected by others, so the final model is typically less prone to overfitting and is more robust, unlikely to be influenced by small changes in training data

## What are Ensemble techniques ?
- [[Bagging]]
- [[Boosting]]
- [[Stacking]]
