[[Bagging]] (Bootstrap aggregation)

![[bagging.excalidraw.svg]]

##### Definitions
-  It is a homogeneous weak learners’ model that learns from each other independently in parallel and combines them for determining the model average.
- Bootstrap Aggregating, also known as bagging, is a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms used in statistical classification and regression.
- It decreases the [variance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mathematics-mean-variance-and-standard-deviation/) and helps to avoid [overfitting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/underfitting-and-overfitting-in-machine-learning/). It is usually applied to [decision tree methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-tree/). Bagging is a special case of the model averaging approach.
Example: [[Random Forest Classifier]]
