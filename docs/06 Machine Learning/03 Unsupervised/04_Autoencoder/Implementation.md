Here's an example of how to implement an autoencoder in Python using the Keras library:

```python
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
from keras.models import Model

# Define the input layer
input_layer = Input(shape=(784,))

# Define the encoder layers
encoder = Dense(256, activation='relu')(input_layer)
encoder = Dense(128, activation='relu')(encoder)
encoder = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoder)

# Define the bottleneck layer
bottleneck = Dense(32, activation='relu')(encoder)

# Define the decoder layers
decoder = Dense(64, activation='relu')(bottleneck)
decoder = Dense(128, activation='relu')(decoder)
decoder = Dense(256, activation='relu')(decoder)

# Define the output layer
output_layer = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(decoder)

# Create the autoencoder model
autoencoder = Model(input_layer, output_layer)

# Compile the model
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

>In this example, we define the input layer with shape 784 (which corresponds to the number of features in the input data), then we define the encoder layers with different number of neurons and activation functions. The encoder layers are used to compress the input data into a lower-dimensional representation. Next, we define the bottleneck layer with 32 neurons, which is the compressed representation of the input data. Then, we define the decoder layers with the same number of neurons and activation functions as the encoder layers, but in reverse order. The decoder layers are used to reconstruct the input data from the bottleneck representation. Finally, we define the output layer with shape 784, which corresponds to the number of features in the input data, and activation function sigmoid.

>It's important to mention that autoencoder can be used for a wide range of applications such as dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, generative models and more. Also, autoencoder can be used with multiple architectures such as Convolutional Autoencoder for image data, Variational Autoencoder for generative models, and more.
