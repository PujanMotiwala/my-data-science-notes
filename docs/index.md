# Welcome!

This site serves as my personal digital garden â€“ a collection of notes, thoughts, code snippets, and summaries related to the vast field of Data Science.

Here you'll find topics covering:

*   Foundational Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Statistics, Calculus)
*   Python Programming for Data Science
*   Data Collection, Cleaning, and Feature Engineering
*   Data Visualization Techniques
*   Core Machine Learning Algorithms and Concepts
*   Deep Learning Fundamentals
*   Big Data Technologies
*   ...and more as I continue to learn and document!
